                        <h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
                        <p>The purpose of this quick start guide is simple: to get you started swiftly. It outlines the essential steps for creating a WordPress.com account and launching your first site. For a more detailed ‘how-to’ on many of these steps, we’ll point you to our in-depth support guides.</p>
                        <p>If you’re on the hunt for comprehensive insights into different facets of website building, we recommend browsing our array of <a class="alink" href="#">courses</a> and <a class="alink" href="#">webinars</a>. The best part? They’re all free!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="second">
                        <h2>Account / Site Creation</h2>
                        <p>To create a WordPress.com account, click this link: <a class="alink" href="#">Get Started↗︎</a> (it’ll open in a new tab, as any link with the ↗︎ icon will). All you need to do is choose your login preference.</p>
                        <p>If you choose the email option, you only need to enter your email address. You won’t be prompted to create a password. You will be sent a verification email, which you will need to confirm your account. If you log out of your account, when you login the next time you’ll be sent an access link.</p>
                        <p>You may want to set a password of your own instead, which you can do from: <a class="alink" href="#">https://wordpress.com/me/security↗︎</a></p>
                        <p>Immediately after choosing a login option for your account, the onboarding process will guide you in creating a new site. Simply follow the onscreen prompts. Remember, with a WordPress.com account, you’re free to create as many sites as you like. Fancy starting with a practice site? Go for it!</p>
                        <p>If you already have a WordPress.com account you can add additional sites any time. If you only have one site in your account, there will be an “Add new site” button at the bottom of the left sidebar. If you have more than one site in your account, you’ll need to click the “Switch site” link at the top of the left sidebar, then you’ll see a list of your existing sites and there will be two buttons at the bottom, one to Manage sites and one to Add new site. The slideshow below shows a visual of these screens:</p>

                        <h2>Choosing a Domain</h2>
                        <p>Every WordPress.com site gets a free domain with <mark style="background-color:#eeeeee" class="has-inline-color">.wordpress.com</mark> in its URL. Feel free to use this — it’s perfectly suitable for a publicly launched site and is free forever.</p>
                        <p>However, if you’d like a more personalized touch, you can either register and buy a custom domain or connect one you already own. To drop that <mark style="background-color:#eeeeee" class="has-inline-color">“.wordpress.com”</mark> from your URL and use a custom domain, you’ll need a paid plan. Good news? The first year of a new domain is bundled in with your plan purchase. And connecting an existing domain doesn’t cost extra.</p>
                        <p>Want to go deeper into the world of domains? Dive in with the <a class="alink" href="#">“Choose a domain”</a> section in our <a class="alink" href="#">“Create Your Site”</a> course. And don’t miss our <a class="alink" href="#">Mastering Custom Domains</a> webinar!</p>
                        <p>Remember, you’re never stuck with your initial choice. Whether you start with a free domain or upgrade to a custom one, you can always switch or add later. So, don’t let domain decisions hold you back!</p>
                        <p>We also have a number of <a class="alink" href="#">support guides regarding domains</a> that cover every situation you can think of.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="second">
                        <h2>
                            Choosing a Plan
                        </h2>
                        <p>After picking your domain, you’ll be prompted to select a hosting plan. This step is crucial for accessing the tools and features that align with your needs. The good news? WordPress.com plans are flexible: start with any plan and upgrade anytime. You’ll be credited for any unused time on your current plan, paying only the price difference for the first year of the new plan.</p>
                        <p>Wondering which plan suits you best? <a class="alink" href="#">Inside your account</a> or on our <a class="alink" href="#">Pricing Page</a>, you’ll find a helpful grid outlining key features of each plan. <strong>For a detailed comparison, simply click the ‘Compare Plans’ button below the grid</strong>. We also offer a <a href="#" class="alink">support guide</a> for an in-depth look at each plan, ensuring you make an informed choice.</p>
                        <p>Want to change your mind later? No worries. You might want to start small, explore, and upgrade as needed, knowing that our support team is always here to help. Downgrading is also possible with assistance from our <a href="#" class="alink">Happiness Engineers</a>.</p>

                            Select a Theme
                        </h2>
                        <p>During the site creation process, you’ll be prompted to “Pick a design”. The theme you choose gets automatically activated for your new site. Don’t stress over this – jumping into <a href="#" class="alink">Appearance > Themes↗︎</a> from your main dashboard allows you to switch things up later.</p>
                        <p>Once your site is created, be sure to explore your theme’s Info page and Demo. You can also explore the info pages of other themes, and you can take any Block theme for test drive using the Preview & Customize option found in the ellipse menu in the bottom right corner of any theme card.</p>
                        <p>Choosing a theme is mostly about the vibe: the colors, fonts, and spacing. The ‘topics’ you see in demos? Just placeholders! All our highlighted Block themes are like clay – moldable. Sure, you can transform any theme entirely, but kickstarting with one that vibes with your vision might save you some tweaking time.</p>
                        <p>Once a theme speaks to you, activate it. Then, the fun of building and personalizing begins.</p>
                        <p>For extra insights, check out our <a href="#" class="alink">Activate a Theme</a> support guide or dive deep with our <a href="#" class="alink">Understanding themes</a> lesson.</p>
                        <p>A huge part of Block themes is mastering Templates. For that, our <a href="#" class="alink">Templates explained</a> lesson is gold.</p>
                        <p><strong>Important!</strong> You’ll see us harp on this in our courses: ensure your Pages and Single Posts templates (sometimes others too) contain the “Content” block. It’s critical for displaying your content. </p>
                        <p>You can change your theme at any time, in fact it’s a great idea to give your site a facelift now and then. When the time comes to switch themes on a live site, our <a href="#" class="alink">Fearless Theme Switching</a> webinar will be your trusty sidekick.</p>

                        <h2>Site Configuration</h2>
                        <p>Let’s set the stage for getting your site up and running:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Head over to your main <a href="#">dashboard↗︎</a>.</li>
                            <li>In the left sidebar, click on <a href="#" class="alink">Settings > General↗︎</a>.</li>
                            <li>Set your Site icon, Site title, Site tagline, Language, Timezone, and more. </li>
                            <li>Feeling excited? Click <strong>Launch</strong> to take the first step. Then, decide your site’s privacy settings: <strong>Coming Soon</strong>, <strong>Public</strong>, or <strong>Private</strong>.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>While you’re here, take a peek at the other options in the sidebar menu. They’ll come in handy as you grow.</p>
                        <p>For a clearer picture of what each setting does, check out our <a href="#" class="alink">Settings</a> support guide.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="second">
                        <h2>Your Homepage</h2>
                        <p>Think of your homepage as your site’s welcome mat. Whether you’ve heard it called a “home page”, “front page”, or even “that main thingy”, it’s the first impression visitors get when they land on your site. You can go for a dynamic blog-style design, or the more static look that’s typical for non-blog sites.</p>
                        <p>The cool thing? Any WordPress.com theme can shape-shift into a blog, a standard website, or a combo of both.</p>
                        <p>Wondering how to set it up? Just pop over to <a href="#" class="alink">Settings > Reading↗︎</a>. From there, decide if you want to roll with the theme’s default setup or jazz things up with a custom homepage.</p>
                        <p>We know, the range of options for your homepage can be a tad overwhelming. While we’ll need a whole separate lesson to dive deep into all the intricacies, for now, you can get a grip on the basics with our guides to <a href="#" class="alink">Set the Homepage</a>, <a href="#" class="alink">Edit the Default Homepage</a>, or <a href="#" class="alink">Create a Custom Homepage</a>.</p>
                        <p>In a hurry to build an inviting homepage? Give our <a href="#" class="alink">Quick Launch</a> course a whirl. And if you’re the kind who loves a visual walkthrough, don’t miss our <a href="#" class="alink">Compelling Homepages</a> webinar.</p>

                        <h2>Creating Your First Page</h2>
                        <p>So, you’ve got a fancy site, picked a snazzy domain and theme, and you’ve set your homepage. It’s time to roll up your sleeves and craft your pages!</p>
                        <p>Hop over to your main <a href="#" class="alink">dashboard↗︎</a> and give <a href="#" class="alink">Pages↗︎</a> in the left sidebar a click. This section showcases pages you’ve already got up and running (if any). Notice the additional tabs up top for Drafts, Scheduled, and Trashed? Whenever you create a new page but get cold feet about publishing it, it cozies up in your Drafts. You can also schedule new pages to publish at a later date. The trash section is just that, it’s the bin for sending away the garbage you don’t want to keep. Don’t think of this as a folder to save things, your trash folder will get emptied everything 30 days (similar to putting your household garbage bin at the bottom of your driveway).</p>
                        <p>Ready to make a new page? Just click the ‘Add new page’ button.</p>
                        <p>If you’re all about efficiency, go for one of the ready-made <a href="#" class="alink">Page Layouts</a>. This convenient WordPress.com option drops a bundle of blocks right into the editor, ready for your magic touch. Opted for a blank page or missed the layout option? No biggie! Keep reading.</p>
                        <p>Title your page something simple like “Contact” or “About Me.” Dive into the editor and start building content with blocks. Look for that + icon in the top-left corner – it’s your gateway to the world of blocks.

                        <h2>Creating Your First Blog Post</h2>
                        <p>Are you planning to publish a blog? Then you’ll want to create posts. In fact, every site can benefit from publishing posts even if it’s not the main focus of the site. Search engines love them, and they’re easier to <a href="#" class="alink">promote</a> to drive traffic to your site.</p>
                        <p>Creating a post is a lot like crafting a page. Pop over to your <a href="#" class="alink">main dashboard↗︎</a> and click on <a href="#" class="alink">Posts↗︎</a> in the sidebar on the left. It’ll look pretty familiar if you’ve been dabbling with pages – think sections for <strong>Published</strong>, <strong>Drafts</strong>, <strong>Scheduled</strong>, and <strong>Trashed</strong>. Ready to roll? Hit that ‘Add new post’ button.</p>
                        <p>Unlike pages, posts skip the Page Layouts. But don’t sweat it! The Block Patterns, available through that nifty block inserter + icon in the top-left corner, have got your layout game covered.</p>
                        <p>Title that post, weave your content, sprinkle in some relevant categories and tags, and click that <strong>Publish</strong> button. It’s a game of practice makes perfect, so the more you create, the quicker you’ll master the art!</p>
                        <p>If you’re publishing posts, you’ll need a spot on your site for visitors to fine them. The most common approach is to create a ‘Blog’ or ‘Posts’ page. Much like the homepage, you have the choice between the theme’s <a href="#" class="alink">Default Posts page</a>, or a <a href="#" class="alink">Custom Posts page</a>, and this setting is also found under <a href="#" class="alink">Settings > Reading↗︎</a>.</p>
                        <p>Craving some extra insight? Our <a href="#" class="alink">Custom Blog Pages</a> webinar has you covered. And, if you’re juggling <a href="#" class="alink">Categories and tags</a>, our lesson on them (part of our treasure packed <a href="#" class="alink">Intro to Blogging</a> course) will light your way.</p>
